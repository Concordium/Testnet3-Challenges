Abservations:
When I clicked "Stop Baking" without entering my account password, 
I got the error "Oops, something went wrong: Unexpected HTTP response: 401:" cannot decrypt signing key with index 0: decryption failure: wrong password ". Baking did not stop.
When I entered my password and did the same "Remove Baker transaction finalized. Baking will stop in 1h54m" information came. 
There is no problem. I shared the screenshots in this folder.
