Observation,
I create a node on the vps, Ubuntu 18.04 bionic. I got this error that "Oops, something went wrong: HTTP Network error".
I learned that I needed to open 8099, 8888 and 8082 ports and by doing it I got "Baker" without any problem. After baking, I am waiting to start and stop staking about 2 hours.
I repeated this task in two different times to learn the system and queue.
The first baking I did on same account,
Baker ID: 159

Baker fees of adding and romeving is equal for 788 and 159. But rewards of 788 is more than 159.
Waiting times were almost equal.
