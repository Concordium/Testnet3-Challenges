My Observations:
1) The timer at my node dashboard synchroniszes with the blockchain at all times, 
there was a network failure on my machine and the time on the node dashboard kept counting.
when the network was back and the dashboard page was refreshed the timer was the same.
2) The baking process started at the same time displayed on my node dashboard(aproximately 1:45mins) which also corresponded with my stopwatch
