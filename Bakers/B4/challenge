Baker Id: 725
Account Address: 3env4vr1ricawYnHrcfneqEJCdrqoZdbzKaBoJUrp7xVhBzCXo

Observation: I started baking with an account then stop it using another browser. 
After 'stop baking transaction' finalized I try to start baking again with another account using the first browser but 
web GUI still shows as running baking with the first account. 
Using a private tab fixed the problem, it's something to do with browser cache I guess.
