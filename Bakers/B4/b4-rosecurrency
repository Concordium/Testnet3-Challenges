Observation,
I create a node on the vps, Ubuntu 18.04 bionic. I got this error that "Oops, something went wrong: HTTP Network error".
I learned that I needed to open 8099, 8888 and 8082 ports and by doing it I got "Baker" without any problem. After baking, I am waiting to start and stop staking about 2 hours.
