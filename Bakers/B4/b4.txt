Baker I.D has changed to 1421 initially was xxxx before hitting start baker 
After successfully stopped baker even though given above transactions number can not be search in dash board explorer?
I had made severals upload adjustments because not sure whats the correct informations to uplaod and affraid of missing out.Hence previous time
it showed my baker rewards in app wallet but not this instance?.Maybe some thing wrong in my node installations this time around I had disable firewalls?
or some thing else?.
