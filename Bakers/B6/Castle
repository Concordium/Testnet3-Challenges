my observations: the hard disk of the node does not use at all, but the wsl2 virtual machine through which Docker works - very much loads RAM.
When you restart the node, the memory load starts at 1.5 gb and after a day it reaches 7.8 gb. this is a problem..
my observations 25.10.2020: process concordium-node.exe - 0.1% memory, 0% disk, 0% CPU. process VMMem - 29.5%
