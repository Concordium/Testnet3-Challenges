Node ID: 786899a224df3bb2
Specs: Hetzner VPS with 2 vCPU, 4GB of RAM and 30GB of SSD storage
Feedback: the node runs smoothly on this VPS, with around than 7% of the CPU used (0.14 load average with two cores)
	Ram is also enough, with 1GB occupied and 3GB free.
	Storage is also fine with only 10GB of 30GB used, but it will be filled up quickly. I will probably need to upgrade it soon
	Logs are really heavy, using 30% of the container. I would try to lighten it.
