Node ID cc8a9e94e5de95e	
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7300HQ 2.50GHz, RAM: 16GB, SSD 256GB	
USING CPU 1,5-4%, USING RAM 141-145MB, USING SSD 0%	
Personally, I see no reason to reload the node 2 times a day, 7 days in a row.	
Having started the network on October 8, I did not notice a heavy load on the PC.	
there are times when the network is updated. shows errors in the browser on the host, but they are solved by updating the browser window.	
The node also works stably and does not crash.
