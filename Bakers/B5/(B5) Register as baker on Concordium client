Observations: I've got one issue with the process, that is 
concordium-client: /var/lib/concordium/config/accounts/names.map: hGetContents: invalid argument (invalid byte sequence)
error when trying to add baker via concordium client. I found the solution, it was the turkish characters on my Account's name. 
Because of the non english characters the client was giving me issues. 
I solved it by removing the accounts that have Turkish characters. Other than that it was pretty smooth, and I'm impressed by it.
