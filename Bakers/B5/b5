Observations: It took me a while to run Baking in the Concordium Client. 
Because I had to research and learn the commands a bit. But the manuals on the website led me a little. 
And I did it by asking people in the community for confirmation. Meanwhile, I had a few bad my baker attempts :) 
As a result, I acknowledged the correctness of the solution I uploaded. 
There's been too much waiting time for stake delegation. At the same time, cookies mislead people a lot. 
But I got it done by checking it through different browsers. I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 on vps (google cloud).
