Baker ID:
Screenshot for client registration command: screenshot is in separate file.
Account address: 373xpWxFWxwYCZqfX2A6BoLtHhsK1bD8r5ufPTAAJyCg41GVfB
Transaction ID of the transaction used to register as a baker: 9c0664624b7b6f826a6a4a81553a96b53b8be9cc43489c36bf438e7601642794
Blockhash of at least one block you produced: None, because I faced some issue after adding baker by client. 
Details: After adding baker by client, I can see a sucess transaction in my account, the explorer also shows that process is confirmed. 
In the screenshot, I can see my new baker ID, 1363, but in my dashboard, it shows that it is not baking. 
I run './concordium-client consensus show-parameters --include-bakers', and I can find my address is listed correctly. 
Then, I tried to delegate to this baker, but I cannot receive any reward. When I use dashboard to add baker and delegate, everything works nice.

Update at 2020-11-15:
It can receive baker rewards now, but in dashboard, it still shows not baking. The reward transaction screenshot is attached.
