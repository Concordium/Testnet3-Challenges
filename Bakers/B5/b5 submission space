I started my node and added my account as a baker.
 I stopped baking after 1 week. After stopping the baking, I tried to import the same account again. 
 I got the warning in "First Stop Baking.PNG" located in this folder. 
 Then I selected the same account and added it as a baker again. Then I clicked "Join stake delegation queue" but there was no action ("Not joined Stake.PNG"). 
 That's why I stopped baking. I added it again as a baker ("Repeat Baking.PNG"). 
Later I was able to stake (Before Join Stake Click.PNG), (After Join Stake Click.PNG). I staked again when staking ended (Before Re-join Stake Click.PNG)
