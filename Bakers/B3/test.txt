restart a node using local DB

Restarted and catching latest block around 1min. 

restart a node with --no-block-state-import

Restarted and catching latest block around 1min. 

restart a node with --listen-grpc-port set to 9999 and start Concordium Client connecting to port 9999

That parameter is not working as expected. i have had to concordium-node-reset-data for cleaning configs and next run docker has started to listen 9999

ss -patn | grep 9999
