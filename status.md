# Testnet 3 Status

## Rationale

The purpose of this document is to provide real-time information when it comes to the Concordium Test Network, including known issues, downtime and any specific event that could alter the participation in the program.


## Known issues, limitations and schedule events

###  ✅ Test Network

* No known issues
* No limitations
* No Scheduled downtime
* ~ 580 running nodes

### ✅ Identity Issuers

* #### Notabene
  * No known issues

### ✅ Challenges & supporting tooling

* No known major issues
* The GTU drop that can be requested on newly created accounts for test purposes has been increased temporarily from 100 GTU to 1000 GTU to ensure that transfer fees can be paid during the transaction challenges. Note that the GTU drop button in the mobile app as well as the related pending transfer details still indicate 100 GTU. You will however receive 1000 GTU on your account when the transfer is finalized.
