Run into a problem in 5th day of challenge. Transaction got stuck and wasn't able to send any transaction after that.
Send 11 transaction, in 3 different hours for 4 days. On last day, sent 16 transactions 
then my transactions got stuck and wasn't able to sent anymore after that
I reckon it might be a bug so I've opened an issue here: https://github.com/Concordium/Testnet3-Challenges/issues/1476
