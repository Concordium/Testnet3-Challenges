Run into a problem in 5th day of challenge. Transaction got stuck and wasn't able to send any transaction after that.
Send 11 transaction, in 3 different hours for 4 days. On last day, sent 16 transactions 
then my transactions got stuck and wasn't able to send anymore transactions after that, even manually couldn't work
I reckon it might be a bug so I've opened an issue here: https://github.com/Concordium/Testnet3-Challenges/issues/1476

I found the issue, it was non sufficient funds that were making transactions stuck but i've not found a solution for that.
So for that, my T4 mission is only successful for 4 days and is incomplete.
