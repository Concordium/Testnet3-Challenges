Case-1 I tried to create an account by choosing “passport” but I uploaded the driving licence just for checking and to see if it will be accepted or not. It accepted the driving licence instead of passport and allowed to create the account with only front page of the driving licence. (Screen Shot-1)

Case-2 I tried by choosing “driving licence” and covered the Licence Number Field. And It didnt work this time. (Screen Shot-2)
