    Information about the document type: Student ID card (i used a student id card instead of the national id card)
    Nationality: Nigeria
    Device make: Tecno model: LB7 and OS version: Andriod 8.1.0
    describe process/experience
    The process was self explanatory, the software rejected too bright and blur pictures.
    
    I couldn't take pictures for upload on a different device( Tecno kc8, os version 9) the software kept on reporting low storage. 
    I had to free up some space, till the device had like 2.9GB free. but the system kept on insisting that the storage was low.
    I finally made an upload using the Tecno LB8 which had 7.78GB of free space
    
    I got two error messages, the first one i didnt know what it was all about. I just had to reupload again before the last verification failed message.
    screenshots are attached
