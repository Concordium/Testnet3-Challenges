Document type:        Expired Russian Visa with picture
Device make and OS:   OnePlus 5 A5000/ Android 9 (OxygenOS 9.0.11)

Experience:
Around five minutes after submitting the error appeared. The russian visa is not supported by Onfido. 
I tried also two times to make an invalid request by choosing the passport option, but as a picture giving one side of the national ID, but both times it did not go through even to be verified or get an error, just got stuck on the first stage.
